B2STAGE-GridFTP (iRODS-DSI)
===============

B2STAGE service core code for EUDAT project: DSI interface


The GridFTP server provides high speed remote access to data stores. 
There are many different types of data storage systems from standard file 
systems to arrays of magnetic tape. 
To allow GridFTP to be used with as many data storage systems as possible, 
the GridFTP can be extended, implementing an interface called Data Storage 
Interface (DSI).

The GridFTP iRODS DSI consists of C based functions, which, through the 
iRODS C API, can interact with iRODS. The main supported operations 
are get, put, delete and list.

The module can be loaded by the GridFTP server at start-up time through 
a specific command line option, therefore no changes are required in the
GridFTP server typical configuration, which makes easier the maintenance 
of the module being decoupled from future changes of the server.




Building iRODS DSI with CMake
--------------------------------

Prerequisite: 

- CMake 2.7 or higher

- globus-gridftp-server-progs
- libglobus-common-dev (.deb) or globus-common-devel (.rpm)
- libglobus-gridftp-server-dev (.deb) or globus-gridftp-server-devel (.rpm)
- libglobus-gridmap-callout-error-dev (.deb) or globus-gridmap-callout-error-devel (.rpm)
(see http://www.ige-project.eu/downloads/software/releases/downloads)

It is possible to use the official gridftp server package without recompiling it.


1. Create a deployment folder:

        mkdir /preferred_path/iRODS_DSI
    
2. Set the following environment variables (it can be done editing and renaming 
   the "setup.sh.template" file in "setup.sh" and source it):

   - GLOBUS_LOCATION --> path to the Globus installation (if you have 
   installed from packages, use '/usr')
   - IRODS_PATH --> path to the iRODS installation (if you have installed 
   from packages, use '/usr')
   - FLAVOR --> (optional, usually not needed) flavors of the Globus packages 
   which are      already installed [a] 
   - DEST_LIB_DIR -->  ````/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI````
   - DEST_BIN_DIR --> ````/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI````
   - DEST_ETC_DIR -->  ````/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI````
   - RESOURCE_MAP_PATH --> (optional) path to the folder containing the 
   "irodsResourceMap.conf" file (see step 4 of section "Configure and run") 
   - IRODS_40_COMPAT --> (optional) Use iRODS 4.0.x compatible library 
   file locations.  (Use for iRODS 4.0.x only, not needed for iRODS 4.1.+).

   Note: comment out any variables not set (as leaving them set to a blank 
   value would prevent CMake from constructing correct default values for 
   variables that are optional).

   [a] This depends on your globus installation. You will probably not need it. 
       In case of error, possible flavors are:
       
            FLAVOR=gcc64dbg
            
       or
       
            FLAVOR=gcc64dbgpthr
            
       You can access this information with gpt-query. 
       Anyway, if the flavor is not correct, the error returned when 
       attempting to run the server should help.

3. Run cmake:
   
        $ cmake (path to CMakeFile.txt)

4. Compile the module:

        $ make

   An error like:
   
        ${IRODS_PATH}/lib/core/obj/libRodsAPIs.a(clientLogin.o):
        relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.bss` can not be used when making 
        a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

   usually happens on x86_64 systems. In order to solve it, recompile iRODS 
   with the mentioned flag, -fPIC:
   
   a) Edit iRODS/config/irods.config and add:
   
       $CCFLAGS = '-fPIC';
   
   b) Rebuild iRODS with ````./irodssetup````
  
5. ````$ make install````
        
   Alternatively you can add the path to the library libglobus_gridftp_server_iRODS.so 
   to the env variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the same environment where you 
   start the GridFTP server.



Configuring and run
--------------------------------

The GridFTP server can be run by an unprivileged user (root privileges are 
not required):

1. Create */preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/irods_environment.json* or 
   */preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/.irodsEnv* (for iRODS < 4.1.x) and populate it 
   with the information related to the "rodsadmin" user; for instance:

        {
           "irods_host" : "irods4",
           "irods_port" : 1247,
           "irods_user_name" : "rods",
           "irods_zone_name" : "tempZone",
           "irods_default_resource" : "demoResc"
        }
          
2. Add the following lines to the GridFTP configuration file ( tipically 
   *$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf* ) :

        $IRODS_ENVIRONMENT_FILE "/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/irods_environment.json"
        #$irodsEnvFile "/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/.irodsEnv"  #for iRODS < 4.1.x
        $LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI"
        $irodsConnectAsAdmin "rods"
        load_dsi_module iRODS 
        auth_level 4

3. Make sure that in iRODS, the GridFTP server certificate DN is associated 
   with the rodsadmin account previously specified in the irods_environment.json, 
   for example:

        $ iadmin lua | grep rods
         rods /C=US/O=Globus Consortium/OU=Globus Connect Service/CN=host/develvm01.pico.cineca.it


4. When deploying with iRODS 4, it is necessary to preload the DSI library 
   into the GridFTP server binary, so that the symbols exported by the library 
   are visible.  Otherwise, when iRODS 4 tries to load the plugins (including 
   basic network and authentication plugins), the plugins would fail to load 
   (as the plugins are not explicitly declaring a dependency on the runtime symbols).

   To preload the library, you need to set the LD_PRELOAD variable to 
   ````/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/libglobus_gridftp_server_iRODS.so```` 
   in the environment from which the GridFTP server is started 
   (i.e., it is not enough to set it in /etc/gridftp.conf). It is necessary 
   to load the GridFTP server library alongside the DSI library (which depends 
   on symbols provided by the GridFTP server library). Otherwise, any command 
   invocation in that environment fails with unresolved symbol errors.

   To do so, add the following lines at the beginning of *globus-gridftp-server*:

        LD_PRELOAD="$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/lib64/libglobus_gridftp_server.so:/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/libglobus_gridftp_server_iRODS.so"
        export LD_PRELOAD

5. In order for GridFTP CKSM (checksum) command to interoperate with Globus.org, 
   it is necessary to configure iRODS to use MD5 checksums 
   (iRODS 4 otherwise defaults to SHA-256). Edit ````/etc/irods/server.config```` 
   and set:

        default_hash_scheme MD5

5. Run the server with:

        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/
        $ /etc/init.d/globus-gridftp-server start
   


Additional configuration
--------------------------------

1. Optionally, it is possible to enable the DSI module to manage the input 
   path as a PID: the DSI will try to resolve the PID and perform the 
   requested operation using the URI returned by the Handle server (currently 
   only listing and downloading is supported).
   
   For instance: 
   
       $globus-url-copy -list gsiftp://develvm01.pico.cineca.it:2811/11100/da3dae0a-6371-11e5-ba64-a41f13eb32b2/
       
    will return the list of objects contained in the collection to which 
    the PID "11100/da3dae0a-6371-11e5-ba64-a41f13eb32b2/" points, or:
    
       $globus-url-copy gsiftp://develvm01.pico.cineca.it:2811/11100/xa3dae0a-6371-11e5-ba64-a41f13eb32b1 /test.txt
    
    will download the object pointed by the PID "11100/da3dae0a-6371-11e5-ba64-e41f13eb32b2".
    
    If the PID resolution fails (either because the Handle server can not 
    resolve it or because the path passed as input is not a PID) the DSI 
    will try to perform the requested operation anyway, using the original 
    input path. This guarantees that the DSI can accept both PIDs and 
    standard iRODS paths.
    
    To enable the PID resolution add the following line to the GridFTP 
    configuration file ( tipically *$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf* ):
    
       $pidHandleServer "http://hdl.handle.net/api/handles"
       
    
    Note: Once the PID is correclty resolved, the requested operation 
    (listing or downloading) will be correctly performed only if the URI 
    returned by the Handle server is a valid iRODS path pointing to the 
    iRODS instance to which the DSI is connected to.



2. If desired, change the default home directory by setting the homeDirPattern 
   environment variable in ````$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf````.  
   The pattern can reference up to two strings with ````%s````, first gets 
   substituted with the zone name, second with the user name.  The default 
   value is ````"/%s/home/%s"````, making the default directory 
   ````/<zone>/home/<username>````.

   Default configuration:

        $homeDirPattern "/%s/home/%s"

   Example alternative configuration (defaulting to ````/<zone>/home````):

        $homeDirPattern "/%s/home"
        
3. It is possible to specify a policy to manage more than one iRODS resource. 
   The DSI module looks for a file called 'irodsresourcemap.conf' (step 1 of 
   the Installation paragraph). In that file it is possible to specify which 
   iRODS  resource has to be used when creating a file in a particular iRODS path.
   For example:
   
        $ cat irodsResourceMap.conf 
        /CINECA01/home/cin_staff/rmucci00;resc-repl
        /CINECA01/home/cin_staff/mrossi;resc-repl

If none of the listed paths is matched, the iRODS default resource is used. 



4. Optionally, use a Globus gridmap callout module to map subject DNs to 
   iRODS user names based on the existing mappings in iRODS (in r_user_auth table). 
   Configuring this feature eliminates the need for a local grid map file 
   - all user mappings can be done through the callout function.

   The gridmap callout configuration file gets already created as 
   '/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/gridmap_iRODS_callout.conf'.

   To activate the module, set the '$GSI_AUTHZ_CONF' environment variable 
   in '$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf' to point to the configuration file 
   already created as '/preferred_path/iRODS_DSI/gridmap_iRODS_callout.conf'.

        $GSI_AUTHZ_CONF /etc/grid-security/gridmap_iRODS_callout.conf
        
   Note that in order for this module to work, the server certificate DN 
   must be authorized to connect as a rodsAdmin user (e.g., the 'rods' user).



5. Optionally (not recommended), turn off the feature that would make the 
   DSI module authenticate as the rods admin user - but operate under the 
   privileges of the target user.

   To do so, remove the line

        $irodsConnectAsAdmin "rods"

   from the /etc/gridftp.conf file.

   It is than necessary to associate the DN of the server with each individual 
   user. In the iCAT associate the irods usernames to the user DNs as well 
   as to the gridftp server DN, for example:

        $ iadmin lua | grep mrossi
        mrossi /C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Personal Certificate/L=CINECA-SAP/CN=Mario Rossi
        mrossi /C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Host/L=CINECA-SAP/CN=fec03.cineca.it

   
   NOTE: this feature is necessary using an  iRODS server version earlier than 3.3.


Additional notes
---------------------------------

This module also supports invoking an iRODS server-side command with iexec 
in case the DN does not have a mapping yet. The command would receive the 
DN being mapped as a single argument and may for example add a mapping to 
an existing account, or create a new account.
To enable this feature, set the '$irodsDnCommand' environment variable in 
'/etc/gridftp.conf' to the name of the command to execute. On the iRODS server, 
the command should be installed in '$IRODS_HOME/server/bin/cmd/'. 
For example, to invoke a script called 'createUser', add:

        $irodsDnCommand "createUser"
    
There is also a command line utility to test the mapping lookups (and script 
execution) that would otherwise be done by the gridmap module. This utility 
command gets installed into '$DEST_BIN_DIR/testirodsmap' and should be 
invoked with the DN as a single argument. 
The command would need to see the same environment variables as the gridmap 
module loaded into the GridFTP server - specifically, '$irodsEnvFile' 
pointing to the iRODS environment and '$irodsDnCommand' setting the command 
to invoke if no mapping is found. The 'testirodsmap' command also needs to 
have access to the server host certificate - and find it either through the 
default mechanisms used by Globus GSI or by explicitly setting the 
'X509_USER_CERT' and 'X509_USER_KEY' environment variables.
(The easiest way is to run the command in the same environment as the Globus 
GridFTP server, i.e., under the root account). For example, invoke the command 
with:

        export irodsDnCommand=createUser 
        export irodsEnvFile=/path/to/.irodsEnv
        $DEST_BIN_DIR/testirodsmap "/C=XX/O=YYY/CN=Example User"
