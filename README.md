B2STAGE-GridFTP
===============

B2STAGE service core code for EUDAT project: DSI interface


The GridFTP server provides high speed remote access to data stores. 
There are many different types of data storage systems from standard 
file systems to arrays of magnetic tape. To allow GridFTP to be used 
with as many data storage systems as possible, the GridFTP can be 
extended, implementing an interface called Data Storage Interface (DSI).

The GridFTP iRODS DSI consists of C based functions, which, through 
the iRODS C API, can interact with iRODS. The main supported operations 
are get, put, delete and list.

The module can be loaded by the GridFTP server at start-up time through 
a specific command line option, therefore no changes are required in the
GridFTP server typical configuration, which makes easier the maintenance 
of the module being decoupled from future changes of the server.




Building iRODS DSI with CMake
--------------------------------

Prerequisite: 

- CMake 2.8 or higher

- globus-gridftp-server-progs
- libglobus-common-dev (.deb) or globus-common-devel (.rpm)
- libglobus-gridftp-server-dev (.deb) or globus-gridftp-server-devel (.rpm)
- libglobus-gridmap-callout-error-dev (.deb) or globus-gridmap-callout-error-devel (.rpm)
(see http://www.ige-project.eu/downloads/software/releases/downloads)


Installation
--------------------------------

The installation is quite simple: it is possible to use the official gridftp 
server package without recompiling it.

1. Set the following environment variables (it can be done editing and renaming 
   the "setup.sh.template" file):

   - GLOBUS_LOCATION --> path to the Globus installation (if you have installed
     the Globus GridFTP Server from packages, use '/usr')
   - IRODS_PATH --> path to the iRODS installation
   - FLAVOR --> (optional) flavors of the Globus packages which are already
     installed[a] 
   - DEST_LIB_DIR --> (optional) path to the folder in which the library will
     be copied
   - DEST_BIN_DIR --> (optional) path to the folder in which binary executables
     (auxilliary tools) will be copied
   - DEST_ETC_DIR --> (optional) path to the folder in which configuration
     files will be copied
   - RESOURCE_MAP_PATH --> (optional) path to the folder containing the 
     "irodsResourceMap.conf" file (see step 4 of section "Configure and run") 
   - IRODS_40_COMPAT --> (optional) Use iRODS 4.0.x compatible library file
     locations.  (Use for iRODS 4.0.x only, not needed for iRODS 4.1.+).

   Note: comment out any variables not set (as leaving them set to a blank
   value would prevent CMake from constructing correct default values for
   variables that are optional).

   [a] This depends on your globus installation. You will probably not need it. 
       In case of error, possible flavors are:
       
            FLAVOR=gcc64dbg
            
       or
       
            FLAVOR=gcc64dbgpthr
            
       You can access this information with gpt-query. 
       Anyway, if the flavor is not correct, the error returned when attempting to run the server should help.

2. Run cmake:
   
        $ cmake (path to CMakeFile.txt)

3. Compile the module:

        $ make

   An error like:
   
        ${IRODS_PATH}/lib/core/obj/libRodsAPIs.a(clientLogin.o):
        relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.bss` can not be used when making a
        shared object; recompile with -fPIC

   usually happens on x86_64 systems. In order to solve it, recompile iRODS with 
   the mentioned flag, -fPIC. This can be done in three alternative ways:

   a) In ${IRODS_PATH} modify the CFLAGS definition in the Makefiles
      * Edit ````clients/icommands/Makefile````, ````lib/Makefile````, and ````server/Makefile````, 
        adding the following line:
        
            CFLAGS +=  -fPIC
          
      * Run: ````make clean && make````

   b) In ````${IRODS_PATH}```` modify the ````CCFLAGS```` variable:  
      * In ````config/irods.config````, set: ````$CCFLAGS = '-fPIC';````
      * In ````config/platform.mk````, set: ````CCFLAGS=-fPIC````
      * Run: ````irodssetup````

   c) In ${IRODS_PATH}, run:
   
        export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC"
        make clean && make

   The solution 'a' has the advantage of woorking even if you later recompile 
   iRODS again. The solution 'b' is the same as solution 'a', but using
   irodssetup instead of make.  That makes the changes persist even after
   irodssetup is re-run. The solution 'c' is faster to be implemented. 

4. Install the module into the GLOBUS_LOCATION. To do this you will need write 
   permission for that directory:

        $ make install 

   If you have installed the Globus GridFTP Server from packages:

        $ sudo make install
  


Configure and run
--------------------------------

In order to run the server as an unprivileged user (root privileges are not 
required):

1. Modify '/etc/gridftp.conf' adding:

        $GRIDMAP "/path/to/grid-mapfile"  
        $irodsEnvFile "/path/to/.irodsEnv" 
        load_dsi_module iRODS 
        auth_level 4

   where '/path/to/.irodsEnv' contains at least the lines:

        irodsHost 'your.irods.server'
        irodsPort 'port'
        irodsZone 'zone'
        irodsAuthScheme 'GSI'


2. In /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile associate the DNs to the irods usernames, 
   for example:

        $ grep mrossi /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
        "/C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Personal Certificate/L=CINECA-SAP/CN=Mario Rossi" mrossi

3. In the iCAT associate the irods usernames to the user DNs as well as to 
   the gridftp server DN, for example:

        $ iadmin lua | grep mrossi
        mrossi /C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Personal Certificate/L=CINECA-SAP/CN=Mario Rossi
        mrossi /C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Host/L=CINECA-SAP/CN=fec03.cineca.it

4. It is possible to specify a policy to manage more than one iRODS resource.
   The DSI module looks for a file called 'irodsresourcemap.conf' (step 1 of the
   Installation paragraph). In that file it is possible to specify which iRODS 
   resource has to be used when creating a file in a particular iRODS path.
   For example:
   
        $ cat irodsResourceMap.conf 
        /CINECA01/home/cin_staff/rmucci00;resc-repl
        /CINECA01/home/cin_staff/mrossi;resc-repl

   If none of the listed paths is matched, the iRODS default resource is used. 

5. Modify the globus-gridftp-server script in /etc/init.d in order to create log
   and pid files where the user who is running the server has the required 
   ownership and run the server with:

        $ /etc/init.d/globus-gridftp-server start
   
   in alternative you can run the server with: 
   
        $ /usr/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -S -d ALL -c $WRKDIR/gridftp.conf


Additional configuration
--------------------------------
1. If desired, change the default home directory by setting the homeDirPattern
   environment variable in ````/etc/gridftp.conf````.  The pattern can
   reference up to two strings with ````%s````, first gets substituted with the
   zone name, second with the user name.  The default value is
   ````"/%s/home/%s"````, making the default directory ````/<zone>/home/<username>````.

   Default configuration:

        $homeDirPattern "/%s/home/%s"

   Example alternative configuration (defaulting to ````/<zone>/home````):

        $homeDirPattern "/%s/home"

2. Optionally, turn on the feature that would make the DSI module authenticate
   as the rods admin user - but operate under the privileges of the target user.

   * Grant the GridFTP server access to the rods account:

            $ iadmin aua rods /C=TW/O=AP/OU=GRID/CN=irodsdev.canterbury.ac.nz
            $ iadmin lua rods
            rods /C=TW/O=AP/OU=GRID/CN=irodsdev.canterbury.ac.nz

   * Make sure 'irodsUserName' is included in the '/path/to/.irodsEnv' file created above:

            irodsUserName rods

   * Set the ````$irodsConnectAsAdmin````  environment variable in ````/etc/gridftp.conf```` to a non-empty value:

            $irodsConnectAsAdmin "rods"

   With all of this in place, it is no longer necessary to associate the DN of the server with each individual user - the server can now access user accounts through the rods account.

   NOTE: this feature requires iRODS server at least 3.3 - GSI authentication with a proxy user breaks on iRODS 3.2 and earlier.

3. Optionally, use a Globus gridmap callout module to map subject DNs to iRODS
   user names based on the existing mappings in iRODS (in r_user_auth table).
   Configuring this feature eliminates the need for a local grid map file - all
   user mappings can be done through the callout function.

   The gridmap callout configuration file gets already created as '$DEST_ETC_DIR/gridmap_iRODS_callout.conf'.

   * To activate the module, set the '$GSI_AUTH_CONF' environment variable in '/etc/gridftp.conf' to point to the configuration file - already created as '$DEST_ETC_DIR/gridmap_iRODS_callout.conf'.

            $GSI_AUTHZ_CONF /etc/grid-security/gridmap_iRODS_callout.conf

   * Note that in order for this module to work, the server certificate DN must
     be authorized to connect as a rodsAdmin user (e.g., the 'rods' user).

   * This module also supports invoking an iRODS server-side command with iexec
     in case the DN does not have a mapping yet.  The command would receive the
     DN being mapped as a single argument and may for example add a mapping to
     an existing account, or create a new account.

   To enable this feature, set the '$irodsDnCommand' environment variable in
   '/etc/gridftp.conf' to the name of the command to execute.  On the iRODS
   server, the command should be installed in '$IRODS_HOME/server/bin/cmd/'.
   For example, to invoke a script called 'createUser', add:

        $irodsDnCommand "createUser"

   * There is also a command line utility to test the mapping lookups (and
     script execution) that would otherwise be done by the gridmap module.
     This utility command gets installed into '$DEST_BIN_DIR/testirodsmap' and
     should be invoked with the DN as a single argument.  The command would
     need to see the same environment variables as the gridmap module loaded
     into the GridFTP server - specifically, '$irodsEnvFile' pointing to the
     iRODS  environment and '$irodsDnCommand' setting the command to invoke if
     no mapping is found.  The 'testirodsmap' command also needs to have access
     to the server host certificate - and find it either through the default
     mechanisms used by Globus GSI or by explicitly setting the
     'X509_USER_CERT' and 'X509_USER_KEY' environment variables.  
     (The easiest way is to run the command in the same environment as the
     Globus GridFTP server, i.e., under the root account).  For example, invoke
     the command with:

            export irodsDnCommand=createUser 
            export irodsEnvFile=/path/to/.irodsEnv
            $DEST_BIN_DIR/testirodsmap "/C=XX/O=YYY/CN=Example User"

4. When deploying with iRODS 4, it is necessary to preload the DSI library into
   the GridFTP server binary, so that the symbols exported by the library are
   visible.  Otherwise, when iRODS 4 tries loading plugins (including basic
   network and authentication plugins), the plugins would fail to load (as the
   plugins are not explicitly declaring a dependency on the runtime symbols).

   To preload the library, you need to set the LD_PRELOAD variable to
   ````$DEST_LIB_DIR/libglobus_gridftp_server_iRODS.so```` (or
   ````$DEST_LIB_DIR/libglobus_gridftp_server_iRODS_$FLAVOR.so````) in the
   environment from which the GridFTP server is started (i.e., it is not enough
   to set it in /etc/gridftp.conf).

   For example, modify (or create) ````/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server````
   and add the lines:

        LD_PRELOAD="$LD_PRELOAD:/opt/iRODS_DSI/iRODS_DSI/libglobus_gridftp_server_iRODS.so"
        export LD_PRELOAD

Logrotate
--------------------------------
If you use -d ALL as in the example, please, be aware that the log files could 
grow quite a lot so the use of logrotate is suggested.
